# MLOPS_DEVOPS_INTEGRATION
Integration of Machine learning and Devops by deploying a model in a container and training it, after training if the accuracy is less than 85 percent then the the tools will tweak the accuracy and train it again once the accuracy is above 85 percentage.

Once the model will achieve the accuracy of 85 percent , the developer will get a mail that his/her model has achieved the accuracy of 85 percent and its ready to predict results.
